End of Month Price changes


Move state to higher level.

Pricing -
- sometimes goes too fast and get Shopify rate error
- eliminate duplicates in the list (not sure why Shopify is returning duplicates)
- change UI, so we know which ones have been done.
- scroll area
- Appliance-Kitchen not working, ran okay when isolated.
- Progress bar percentage is all wrong.
- Perhaps change tracking, create a card for each one, initialize it when going through the list, update it when complete.
